In general people like to say that one should not be bound to any particular language
and instead should be able to switch languages as and when required. However it is also
common to see that programmers, especially those with many years of experience, loathe
this concept.

We tend to dismiss this by saying that they are set in their ways and that they are being stubborn
& don't want to make the effort. However that might not be true in all cases, what a younger developer
tends to not understand is that a veteran developer has spent an insurmountable amount of time understanding
and mastering their craft. They have gained command over their tools of trade that allows them to bend the world
to their will. Indeed it is a frightening thought to ask someone to abandon their previous knowledge and start from
the beginning because they will always be conscious of the vast disparity between their skills of the old and the
skill level they have now.

To a developer who still hasn't learned more than a few techniques, this is of little consequence.
However, this becomes a very painful handicap for those who lose a lot by making such a transition.
