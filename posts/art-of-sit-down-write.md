Ever been afraid to start? Maybe to start writing or working out or drawing or painting. Ever been stuck because you have no idea where to begin? I know I have been there and hated it.

I published a technical book and when I met a friend afterwards, he asked me for my writing process - inspiration, rituals, how I kept myself going etc.

I tried not to be rude but best I could manage was to answer, "You sit down and write."

He was not pleased, to say the least, but that's the truth...

> You sit down and write.

There is nothing new here. If you have ever read any book on creativity, you will have read this same message a million times and rolled your eyes. _It's easy for you to say! You don't know how hard it is for me to muster the strength and put myself into it._

Unfortunately I think this is one of those basic truths that no one wants to hear nor acknowledge.

Hear me out...

- I wanted to learn how to play a musical instrument but never had a chance as a kid. Finally I decided to commit to it and lo & behold, improv music jam is my thing.

- I was never good at drawing. I got annoyed at one point and decided to just start copying images. Turns out, you can learn a lot on your own if you give it time and focus. You might not perfect it but that's not the goal here.

- I had no idea how to Journal and I still don't. Every person I hear talk about it has a different version of it. But there was a lot of stuff I had to deal with and so, I started writing. I went to a shop and bought a nice set of fountain pen & Journal[^3]. I vaguely knew what I wanted and bought the first thing that caught my eye[^7].

Here's something important to remember

> If you don't take your needs seriously no one else will.

Be intentional and be deliberate with your actions and you will find a way to make it work[^5]. 

**Does this mean I can do everything in my life now?**

> Hell No!

Right now I am stuck in a slump myself. Been ages since I drew anything and my writing has been suffering.

However I have learned to not beat myself over it. It's important to understand such slumps are normal.

## Conclusion

The key lies in recognizing that such high productivity states are not permanent but they come and go.

Think of it as phases or seasons of life.


[^3]: I actually bought Lechtturm Bullet Journal but ended up using it as a regular journal with my own system. Turns out, organically coming up with your own system works better than using someone else's system that requires you to learn the process.

[^5]: I am not saying world will bend over backwards to make things happen for it won't. There is a more realistic way things can work out if you are being mindful about it.

[^7]: With reasonable budget.
