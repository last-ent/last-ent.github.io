# Productivity for the Overwhelmed & the Anxious

A few years back I was suffering from terrible anxiety which basically made it impossible for me to get anything done.

It was a mix between

- Fear of wasting time on wrong thing
- Fear of prioritizing incorrectly
- Fear of forgetting important tasks
- *the list goes on...*

Many of these were valid concerns and while I knew about a few task management systems (GTD, Pomodoro, etc) they had some strict rules (and for good reasons) but not useful when suffering from anxiety and indecision. I had to come up with a system that would work while taking my anxiety into account.

Few things the system had to do:

1. Let me categorize tasks in order of importance/significance.
2. Be flexible in case of wrong categorization.
3. Create a sense of progression.
4. Let me add new tasks when they pop in my mind during the day.
5. Create certainty around time spent on each task.

# The System
I started with a sheet of paper and writing down a table with four columns/categories.

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| .         | .         | .     | .           |
|           |           |       |             |

## Categories/Columns

- **Immediate** tasks are what you feel should be done immediately or by EOD.
- **Important** tasks are important and you want to get to ASAP or perhaps by next day.
- **Bonus** tasks are nice if you can get to them today.
- **Back burner** are tasks you need to get done but they aren't as pressing as other tasks.

## First Steps

- On first day add in all the tasks that are in your head with the priority based on column
- The order within the column is irrelevant.
- **Strike Out Rule**: Once a task is done, strike it out.

## Picking a Task

- Look at the list of tasks and pick the task that **appeals to you** the most **at the moment**.
- Try to pick from **Immediate** & **Important**.
- Do not pick a task from **Back burner** during the day unless it's really crucial or your guts really tells you to.

## Adding new tasks

- **New Task Rule**: If new tasks pop up in your head add them to any category EXCEPT **Immediate**.

At some point you might realize that you are done with the original task but there is follow up work to do.
- Strike out the original task (**Strike Out Rule**)
- Treat these new tasks as described in **New Task Rule**
- Keep going through the task list for as long as you can manage.

## Timeboxing

- Divide your time into manageable time slots (try 25 minutes) of work
- Pick a task, start the timer and start working.
- After the time is up, take rest for 5-10 minutes.
- If you have been working for more than three time slots take longer rest if required.

## On Task Completion
 If the task is completed within the time slot
 
- Strike it out (**Strike Out Rule**) and
- Relax for rest of the slot or,
- Pick another task (maybe from **Bonus**?) you think you can fit within the slot

## If time runs out on Task
If the task isn't completed within the slot

- Continue working on it in next slot or,
- Pick another task for next slot

## Next Day
Next day take a fresh sheet of paper and start filling out the categories with tasks.

- Tasks from previous day can be in same category as before
- You can move them to different category if priorities have changed
- Since you are creating your task list for the day, **New Task Rule** does not apply. ie., New tasks that pop up while creating the list can go into **Immediate** category.

# Example
Now let's look at an example:

## Day 1

At the start of the day I have following set of tasks.

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| A         | G         | D     | E           |
| C         | B         | F     | H           |
| I         | M         | J     | X           |
|           | L         |       |             |
|           | K         |       |             |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I start working on Task `A` (**Immediate**) 
- I complete it by end of my time slot
- I strike it out (Denoted by **`Bold & Code style`**)

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **`A`**   | G         | D     | E           |
| C         | B         | F     | H           |
| I         | M         | J     | X           |
|           | L         |       |             |
|           | K         |       |             |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- After my 5 minutes of rest
- I pick Task `K` (**Important**)
- I complete it with 15 minutes to spare
- I decide to rest
- I strike out the completed task

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **`A`**   | G         | D     | E           |
| C         | B         | F     | H           |
| I         | M         | J     | X           |
|           | L         |       |             |
|           | **`K`**   |       |             |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I skip the 5 minutes of rest
- I pick Task `F` because I want to get it done (**Bonus**)
- At some point, I remember that I have to take care of Task `Z`, I add it to **Back burner**
- I complete Task `F` by the end of slot & I strike it out

| Immediate | Important | Bonus   | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **`A`**   | G         | D       | E           |
| C         | B         | **`F`** | H           |
| I         | M         | J       | X           |
|           | L         |         | **Z**       |
|           | **`K`**   |         |             |

I can do more tasks but I decide to end the day.

## Day 2

I start by taking a look at my list from yesterday and picking out the tasks that are yet to be done.

### Yesterday's list

| Immediate | Important | Bonus   | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **`A`**   | G         | D       | E           |
| C         | B         | **`F`** | H           |
| I         | M         | J       | X           |
|           | L         |         | **Z**       |
|           | **`K`**   |         |             |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Carry over tasks

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
|           | G         | D     | E           |
| C         | B         |       | H           |
| I         | M         | J     | X           |
|           | L         |       | **Z**       |
|           |           |       |             |

Now that I have the list of carry over tasks, I can start with creating my task list for the day.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Let's fill in today's tasks

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| .         | .         | .     | .           |
|           |           |       |             |


- I feel `C` & `I` should go into **Immediate**
- Tasks `G`, `B`, `L` should go into **Important**

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| C         | G         |       |             |
| I         | B         |       |             |
|           | L         |       |             |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Turns out task `L` & `J` are no longer pressing, so they go into **Back burner**
- A new task `R` came up and I think it is **Important**
- Two more `Q` & `P` tasks pop up but they can go into **Bonus**

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| C         | G         | Q     | L           |
| I         | B         | P     | J           |
|           | L         |       |             |
|           | R         |       |             |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Task `Z`, which I put on **Back burner** yesterday, is urgent and now goes into **Immediate**
- **Back burner** tasks `E`, `H` & `X` haven't changed in priority, so they stay put.

| Immediate | Important | Bonus | Back burner |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| C         | G         | Q     | L           |
| I         | B         | P     | J           |
| Z         | L         |       | E           |
|           | R         |       | H           |
|           |           |       | X           |

# Conclusion

I hope you can find some use for this system if not as much as it helped me. There are scientific reasons for why the system works but I will elaborate them on another post.
