```text
I miss the days of yore,
where blogs had focus broad.
A mix of hobbies or talents varied,
a window into a person's psyche.

A journal of sorts where they write,
of things that spark their interests and delights.
Then came the internet of modern times,
that asked of everything, to be commercialized.

I protest, I detest,
this utilitarian web.
`Off Topic` is where,
I break this thread.
