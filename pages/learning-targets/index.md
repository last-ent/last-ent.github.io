Here's a list of things that I want to learn and how I think might be the best way to learn them. Truth be told I prefer to learn using books. For some reason watching videos or doing online courses don't really help me much. They have their own pace and I want to take my time going thru material and jump around if need be. Books are somewhat better at this IMO. Without further ado, here's my list!

## Practical Set
These are the topics/subjects that I think are interesting to know and would come in handy in my professional or daily life.
