I am a polyglot Software Engineer who loves to learn and experiment with different topics.

## Domains
I have worked in & built large scale systems for different domains:

* Physics Simulation Models
* Ad Tech
* E-Commerce


## Talks

* [Concurrency the Functional Way](https://slides.com/last-ent/concurrency-functional-way#/) *(Slides)* [^1]
* [Runtime & Concurrency in Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64XXaIC-K74) *(YouTube)* [^2] 
* [How to Design a File System](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/yTAwCw9KSGdIvp) *(Slides)* [^3]

## Books

* [Distributed Computing with Go](https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Computing-concurrency-parallelism-applications/dp/1787125386/)[^4] 

## Languages

* Scala
* Python
* Golang

[^1]: Deep dive into concurrency, parallelism & how Functional Programming leverages it.

[^2]: Goroutines are amazing - They work across multiple cores and spawn multitude of threads. The talk will cover Lifecycle of a Go binary GIL (or lack thereof), Green Threads, event loops and Coroutines as well as goroutine gotchas.

[^3]: Operating System & Programming Languages - Who hasnâ€™t dreamt of building one? However we never hear people talk about wanting to build a File System. In this talk, I want go through the basic concepts one might need to understand to implement a File System on their own.

[^4]: Are you interested to learn about how to use goroutines & channels? Want to learn how concurrency patterns are used in Go? This book is your goto for deep dive into these topics.
