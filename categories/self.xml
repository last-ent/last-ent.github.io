Maybe to start writing or working out or drawing or painting. Ever been stuck because you have no idea where to begin? I know I have been there and hated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I published a technical book and when I met a friend afterwards, he asked me for my writing process - inspiration, rituals, how I kept myself going etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried not to be rude but best I could manage was to answer, "You sit down and write."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not pleased, to say the least, but that's the truth...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sit down and write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing new here. If you have ever read any book on creativity, you will have read this same message a million times and rolled your eyes. &lt;em&gt;It's easy for you to say! You don't know how hard it is for me to muster the strength and put myself into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I think this is one of those basic truths that no one wants to hear nor acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
