Maybe to start writing or working out or drawing or painting. Ever been stuck because you have no idea where to begin? I know I have been there and hated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I published a technical book and when I met a friend afterwards, he asked me for my writing process - inspiration, rituals, how I kept myself going etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried not to be rude but best I could manage was to answer, "You sit down and write."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not pleased, to say the least, but that's the truth...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sit down and write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing new here. If you have ever read any book on creativity, you will have read this same message a million times and rolled your eyes. &lt;em&gt;It's easy for you to say! You don't know how hard it is for me to muster the strength and put myself into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I think this is one of those basic truths that no one wants to hear nor acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years back I was suffering from terrible anxiety which basically made it impossible for me to get anything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a mix between&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of wasting time on wrong thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of prioritizing incorrectly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of forgetting important tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;the list goes on...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these were valid concerns and while I knew about a few task management systems (GTD, Pomodoro, etc) they had some strict rules (and for good reasons) but not useful when suffering from anxiety and indecision. I had to come up with a system that would work while taking my anxiety into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few things the system had to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let me categorize tasks in order of importance/significance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be flexible in case of wrong categorization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a sense of progression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let me add new tasks when they pop in my mind during the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create certainty around time spent on each task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
