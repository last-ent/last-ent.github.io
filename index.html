<p>In this essay I will talk about a term you might've come across when reading scientific literature or research papers. Idea is to develop gut feeling (intuition) for what the text is saying when <strong>Monte Carlo Method</strong> is mentioned.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p><strong>Monte Carlo Method (MCm)</strong> builds on top of other topics and concepts, taking time to understand them will make learning about <strong>MCm</strong> quite easy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Randomness in computers</li>
<li>Law of Large Numbers</li>
<li>System or Process Model</li>
<li>Probability Distribution (Function)</li>
<li>Deterministic Computation (Function)</li>
<li>Markov Chain</li>
</ol>
<h3>Randomness in Computers</h3>
<p>Random numbers generated in computers are not truly random but are "pseudo-random". True randomness is hard to implement in computers and in many cases not even desirable.</p>
<p>Randomness in computers is useful when we want to remove predictability from a sequence or program. This means two things</p>
<ul>
<li>No predictable pattern to numbers generated</li>
<li>Mathematically proven the generated "random numbers" are indeed random.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two criteria might seem to contradictory but what this means is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pattern of random numbers generated should be unpredictable for layperson and be computationally impossible to <em>crack</em> (predict).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truth is we want the ability to recreate the random number sequence, this comes in handy when we want to test or debug an algorithm. For this reason these pseudo-random generators take a <strong>seed value</strong>. This way we can create a repeatable pseudo-random sequence.</p>
<p><em>Note: It is possible to create pseudo-random numbers. Such generators rely upon random events such as user input.</em></p>
<h3>Law of Large Numbers</h3>
<p>Scientific experiments are conducted multiple times before the results are published because there can be mistakes or error in measurements made during the experiment. These errors can lead to incorrect conclusion being made.</p>
<p>Turns out that if we are able to conduct an experiment multiple times and aggregate<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/monte-carlo-method/#fn:1">1</a></sup> the results, the margin of error drop down to zero<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/monte-carlo-method/#fn:2">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Put another way</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The probability or accuracy of an experiment will increase with greater iteration of the experiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>System or Process Model</h3>
<p>In science &amp; engineering we try to define a mathematical model of a phenomenon/system using a set of values to describe it's current state, future state and what caused changed in the state via different sets of values.</p>
<p>That is, we can use a model to describe the state of a system in terms of given input of values vs. expected output of values.</p>
<h3>Probability Distribution (Function)</h3>
<p>If we can define a process as a set of values that have been measured or observed over time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this defined domain of values, in a Probability Distribution, each value has equal likelihood of being picked up.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Deterministic Computation (Function)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Computation or function that will return same output for same input values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note: In Mathematics or Functional Programming, this is same as a Pure Function.</em></p>
<h3>Markov Chain</h3>
<p><strong>System or Process Model</strong> can have internal states that are dependent on one another. It can also have output states that can be used as input for next iteration.</p>
<p>Markov Chain is one method to define such a system in terms of states and transitions ie., how it moves from one state to next.</p>
<h4>Markov Property</h4>
<p>A system is a Markov chain IFF<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/monte-carlo-method/#fn:3">3</a></sup> the transition to next state does not depend on current state ie., it is "<em>Memoryless</em>".</p>
<h2>Monte Carlo Method (MCm)</h2>
<p>Goal of Monte Carlo Method is to use experimentation or simulations to predict the outcome of a system with greatest accuracy possible.</p>
<p><strong>MCm</strong> has a specific process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runs the same experiment multiple times</li>
<li>Over a small sample of random inputs</li>
<li>Averages these Outputs for most probable outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>Put another way<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/monte-carlo-method/#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Define a domain of possible Inputs</li>
<li>Use <strong>Probability Distribution</strong> over the domain to select random Inputs</li>
<li>Perform <strong>Deterministic Computations</strong>
</li>
<li>Aggregate the results which should give us an accurate prediction of output based on <strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo method uses a random set of values generated from a markov chain as inputs for Markov Chain Method/Simulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine you have 10 readings and actual value is 5. But you have values greater than actual value - 6 (5+1), 7 (5+2) &amp; 8 (5+3). Similarly you have values less than actual value - 4 (5-1), 3 (5-2) &amp; 2 (5-3). If you average these out, you will get 5 as the answer. Of course, in practice things aren't going to be this simple but this should give you an idea. <a class="footnote-backref" href="posts/monte-carlo-method/#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>Ever been afraid to start? Maybe to start writing or working out or drawing or painting. Ever been stuck because you have no idea where to begin? I know I have been there and hated it.</p>
<p>I published a technical book and when I met a friend afterwards, he asked me for my writing process - inspiration, rituals, how I kept myself going etc.</p>
<p>I tried not to be rude but best I could manage was to answer, "You sit down and write."</p>
<p>He was not pleased, to say the least, but that's the truth...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You sit down and write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing new here. If you have ever read any book on creativity, you will have read this same message a million times and rolled your eyes. <em>It's easy for you to say! You don't know how hard it is for me to muster the strength and put myself into it.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately I think this is one of those basic truths that no one wants to hear nor acknowledge.</p>

<p>My first job was at an IT Services company.</p>
<p>My title was Software Engineer but the work was stupid<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/startup-that-broke-me/#fn:1">1</a></sup> and management was even more stupid<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/startup-that-broke-me/#fn:3">2</a></sup>. I vowed to never work at a BigCorp again.</p>
<p>I followed this up by working at startups but many of them failed and soon I became an expert at "This project/company is gonna die!".</p>
<p>At first I saw this as a curse but eventually I came to see this as a boon. If you can tell the future, you can avoid mental/emotional trauma<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/startup-that-broke-me/#fn:4">3</a></sup>. </p>
<h3>The Startup that broke me</h3>
<p>I work at a BigCorp now<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/startup-that-broke-me/#fn:5">4</a></sup> and all credit goes to the last startup I worked at.</p>

<h2>What is the best way to get started with Frontend development in 2021?</h2>
<p>Every time I start looking at the current state of Frontend tools it starts to freak me out.</p>
<h3>The start</h3>
<p>I decided to bite the bullet and VueJS felt alluring.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ npx create-vue-app
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Lo &amp; Behold! I have an app with has around <strong>100+ vulnerabilities.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I try to update and <code>--force</code> update the deps and I still have <strong>70 vulnerabilities left</strong>.</p>
<p>I will be honest with you, it does not feel good to create a fresh app with so many issues preinstalled.</p>

<h2>Productivity for the Overwhelmed &amp; the Anxious</h2>
<p>A few years back I was suffering from terrible anxiety which basically made it impossible for me to get anything done.</p>
<p>It was a mix between</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of wasting time on wrong thing</li>
<li>Fear of prioritizing incorrectly</li>
<li>Fear of forgetting important tasks</li>
<li><em>the list goes on...</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these were valid concerns and while I knew about a few task management systems (GTD, Pomodoro, etc) they had some strict rules (and for good reasons) but not useful when suffering from anxiety and indecision. I had to come up with a system that would work while taking my anxiety into account.</p>
<p>Few things the system had to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let me categorize tasks in order of importance/significance.</li>
<li>Be flexible in case of wrong categorization.</li>
<li>Create a sense of progression.</li>
<li>Let me add new tasks when they pop in my mind during the day.</li>
<li>Create certainty around time spent on each task.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Backbone of Functional Programming</h2>
<p><code>map</code> &amp; <code>flatmap</code> form the backbone of Functional Progamming. It is very important be comfortable with these two concepts and this guide will help you develop an intuition for them.</p>
<p>This guide is language agnostic but I expect you to be familiar with basic programming concepts like functions, types, data type/objects and list. </p>
<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>Let me introduce you to some basic terms we will be using to talk about <code>map/flatmap</code>.</p>

<li>
<code>Type</code>s are data constructs and they can be <code>Basic Types</code> like Int, String etc.</li>
<li>
<code>Container</code> is a special <code>type</code> which contains another <code>type</code>. For example a List of Ints.</li>
<li>
<code>Function</code> is a function whose input is of Type 1 and output is of Type 2. Type 1 &amp; Type 2 can be same type.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visualize</h3>
<p>Though I have defined three terms it will be easier to think about them visually.</p>
<h4>
<code>Basic types</code> (Int, String etc) will be represented by shapes</h4>

<p>I know what you are thinking</p>

<p><em>I thought this was a programming blog, wtc is this?</em> <strong>But hear me out!</strong></p>
<p>Few weeks ago I saw a video by Matt D'Avella where he was talking a quick healthy snack and the part showed him putting a few dried corn kernels into a small vessel and after a few minutes, popcorn ready.</p>
<p>That intrigued me, to say the least.</p>
<p>I gave it a try and <code>Yes, it's that simple</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Popcorn I made" src="images/popcorn.jpeg"></p>
<p>A few things to keep in mind of course, so read on if it interests you.</p>
<h2>Salted Popcorn</h2>
<ol>
<li>Take a small iron pot. (Preferably with thich bottom)</li>
<li>Add in some oil. (I used Olive Oil)</li>
<li>Drop the kernels into the oil.</li>
<li>Partially cover it with a lid.</li>
<li>Wait for em to pop!</li>
<li>Add in a bit salt (not too much!) and shake em around.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Movie Popcorn</h2>
<p>Do you yearn for the popcorn we get at movies without the unhealthy side of it? Yes, <em>you can make it at home.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Take a small iron pot. (Preferably with thich bottom)</li>
<li>Add in clarified butter. (Not normal butter)
3-6. Same as before.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Things to know</h2>
<h3>Why to partially cover the lid?</h3>
<p>The kernels have some amount of moisture in them. By partially opening the lid, you let the water vapour out getting them crunchy.</p>
<p>Also the reason the kernels pop is because the moisture inside the kernels get super heated and need to vent out.</p>
<h3>Why not normal butter?</h3>
<p>If you heat normal butter for long, it starts burning. This is because of milk residue in the butter.</p>
<p>Also it has moisture in it causing popcorn to get soggy.</p>
<h3>Don't use too much Oil!</h3>
<p>If you add in too much oil, there is a chance the popcorn will get soggy (that was my experience).</p>
<p>Also the popcorn will smell &amp; taste lot more of the oil used. While I love me some Olive Oil, too much on my popcorn feels weird.</p>
<h3>Variation on Cooking Style</h3>
<p>One variation I read online is to wait until the oil heats up sufficiently before putting in the kernels.</p>
<p>How do you know when the oil is ready? Put in a kernel or two at the start and wait for both of them to pop before you put in the rest.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So there you have it folks!</p>
<p>That's how I am now addicted to my evening popcorn.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have used many editors over time and one "System" that I really enjoyed was Emacs. However I did not understand how it worked under the hood and it led to some fun times. This post is an attempt to log my experience with learning and understanding the "missing bits" in a single place. </p>
<p>This guide is consolidation of knowledge &amp; experience of 2-3 days of intense focus learning &amp; modifying Emacs.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The aim of this guide is to quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap your understanding to a level where you can start thinking in terms Emacs' terminology and use that knowledge to searching the internet for new questions you might have. </li>
<li>Develop a rudimentary understanding of how to customize Emacs. </li>
<li>Setup an aesthically pleasing UI with usable setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide IS NOT about the basics of text editors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are text editors? What is Emacs or Vim?</li>
<li>Which editor should I use?</li>
<li>How to navigate using either editor?</li>
<li>How to read/write <code>elisp</code>. I have a basic understanding of lisp/clojure but otherwise I haven't bothered with learning it for this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Static Website Hosting</h2>
<p>I really like the low footprint and utility of Static Websites. This website is built using <code>Nikola</code>.</p>
<p>In this post I will talk about some issues I faced with deploying a second static website and how I eventually solved it.</p>
<h3>Github Pages</h3>
<p>I have long enjoyed the awesomeness of <code>User Github Pages</code> and am quite happy with it.</p>
<p>However as soon as I tried to create a second independent static website with custom domain, <code>Github</code> was having nothing of it.</p>
<p>After spending lot of time scouring the web for how to make it work between <code>Github</code> &amp; <code>Namecheap</code>, my DNS provider, I had nothing to show for it.</p>
